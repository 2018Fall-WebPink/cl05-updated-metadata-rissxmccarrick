        <p>To me, Christmas is a time of giving and rejoicing. It is a celebration where you rejoice Jesus' birth. Christmas is my favorite holiday of the year because I spend my time with friends and family. During this season of giving, we gather to decorate a Christmas tree and give each other gifts.</p>
        <p2>A family tradition that my family does during the time of giving is pollyanna. We randomly pick each other's names out of a hat and get each other gifts. Another gift we do is the pickle. On Christmas Eve, my parents hide a pickle ornament in the tree and whoever finds it first, gets to open a gift early. Over the years, I have found it every year, so my sister and I both open a present regarding on who finds it.</p2>
